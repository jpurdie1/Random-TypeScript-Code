# Random-TypeScript-Code
various code written in TypeScript for viewing by others (a brief overview of my personal code)

I have compiled a sampling of code that I have personally written in TypeScript. I have also worked with JavaScript. I hope that this gives you a general sense of my abilities. I will be working more heavily with JavaScript and Java in the near future.
